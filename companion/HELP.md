## obs-multisite

Control a Multisite broadcast from Companion: start and stop the event at the
main site, and drive a campus feed's timeslipping — play, hold, catch up, jog —
with buttons that light up to show what is actually happening.

It can drive any end of the system: **OBS** running the obs-multisite plugin; a
**campus player** appliance, which has no OBS and answers over its own HTTP
interface; or an **Outpost box** (MultisiteOS), as a campus decoder or a
main-site encoder. Pick which when you add the connection; the buttons are the
same.

### Configuration

- **Connect to** — _OBS_, _a campus player appliance_ or _an Outpost box_.
- **Host** — where that machine is. `127.0.0.1` if Companion is on the same machine.
- **Port** — leave 0 for the default: **4455** for OBS, **8080** for a campus
  player, **80** for an Outpost box.
- **OBS WebSocket password** — OBS only, from Tools → WebSocket Server Settings,
  if you set one.

**For OBS** you also need the obs-multisite plugin loaded (Tools → Multisite, or
a Multisite source in the scene) and the WebSocket Server turned on. The module
opens its own connection, so the host, port and password are the same values you
may have given the OBS Studio module — Companion modules each own their
connection.

**For a campus player** there is nothing to switch on, and no password: the
appliance's interface is guarded by the network it is on and by its own Lock.

**For an Outpost box** there is nothing to switch on either, and no PIN, even if
the box has an admin PIN set: its page leaves every control a service needs open
without one, and this module calls nothing else. The box is one shape at a
time, a campus **decoder** or a main-site **encoder**, and the module asks which
every five seconds. If somebody changes it on the box's page, the actions,
feedbacks, variables and presets on offer change with it.

### Actions

**Main site (encoder) — OBS, or an Outpost box that is an encoder.** A campus
player only ever receives, so these are not offered against one.

- **Go live** — start the event. Leave the name blank to name it with the
  current time, exactly as the dock does. An Outpost encoder names the event
  itself; in its web mode this starts the live stream.
- **End the broadcast** — finish cleanly.
- **Drop a marker** — pick one of the markers the main site published, or type
  your own. The list is the main site's configured cues, and fills in as soon as
  it is connected. _An Outpost encoder cannot drop a marker yet_; the button
  says so in the log.
- **Check the input** _(Outpost only)_ — show the picture and the sound on the
  box for up to five minutes without recording or streaming anything. Start,
  stop, or toggle.

**Campus (decoder)**

- **Play / Stop / Hold / Resume** — the transport. _Hold_ keeps the picture on
  screen and stops advancing; _Resume_ continues from where it stopped.
- **Catch up to live** — jump to the live edge.
- **Return to the room** — stop playing a past recording and follow whatever the
  room is live with.
- **Jog** — step forward or back by a number of seconds (negative goes back).
- **Seek** — go to a clock time within the recording (seconds from midnight).
  Against a campus player or an Outpost box the time is the one on the computer
  running Companion, turned into a position in the programme; a time before it
  started or after the live edge goes to that edge, and the log says so.
- **Sit behind live** — hold a constant delay behind live. Zero returns to the
  live edge.
- **Jump to a marker** — go to a cue. The list is _this room's_ markers: the ones
  any site has actually dropped, on either end, each showing the site that set
  it. A cue dropped while you are watching appears in the list by itself.
- **Campus: Drop a cue** — drop a cue with a name of your own from this campus.
  Every site sees it, carrying this box's site name, so a cue set here is never
  mistaken for the main site's.
- **Load a recording** — play a past event from this room. Pinning does not
  follow the room afterwards.
- **Refresh the recordings list** — ask the room what it has recorded. The list
  is filled in when the module connects; this is for after an event ends.
- **Lock the controls** _(campus player and Outpost)_ — the player's own lock:
  lock, unlock, or toggle. While it is on, every control refuses, on its page and
  here alike, and the refusal says so.
- **Hold or resume** _(campus player and Outpost)_ — one button for both.

**Any obs-multisite request** — call any command of the plugin by name, with a
JSON object. The escape hatch for a command a newer plugin has that this module
does not yet.

### Feedbacks

- **Encoder: the broadcast is live** _(OBS, Outpost encoder)_
- **Encoder: the link is degraded or offline** _(OBS, Outpost encoder)_ — on an
  Outpost, the upload in Multisite mode and the stream in web mode.
- **Outpost encoder: the web stream is landing / checking the input / sound is
  arriving**
- **Decoder: playing / held / buffering / loading**
- **Decoder: no source on this machine** — the fix is in the scene collection,
  not on the surface.
- **Decoder: the recording has ended**
- **Decoder: more than N seconds behind live**
- **Decoder: the link is degraded or offline**
- **Decoder: the controls are locked**
- **Outpost: the box is not answering**
- **Outpost: the box is running hot** — within a margin (10 °C by default) of
  the temperature at which the box slows itself down, which it reports itself,
  or already slowing down.

A link reading is only shown once it is a real measurement; before anything has
been tried it is blank rather than "healthy".

### Variables

Encoder _(OBS, Outpost encoder)_: `encoder_live`, `encoder_status`, `encoder_event_id`,
`encoder_event_name`, `encoder_room`, `encoder_confirmed`, `encoder_pending`,
`encoder_retries`, `encoder_bytes`, `encoder_upload_rate`, `encoder_link`,
`encoder_colo`, `encoder_version`. An Outpost encoder also fills
`encoder_mode`, `encoder_web_address`, `encoder_web_speed`, `encoder_web_sent`,
`encoder_source` and `encoder_fps`, and `encoder_status` says _Recording_,
_Streaming_, _Connecting_, _Waiting for a picture_ or _Checking the input_.

Outpost: `shape` (decoder or encoder) and `temperature`.

Decoder: `decoder_state`, `decoder_have_source`, `decoder_playing`,
`decoder_held`, `decoder_buffering`, `decoder_loading`, `decoder_ended`,
`decoder_behind_live`, `decoder_playhead`, `decoder_live`,
`decoder_cached_segments`, `decoder_link`, `decoder_current_marker`,
`decoder_event_id`, `decoder_room`, `decoder_version`.

Against a campus player, a few of the decoder's are simply blank because the
appliance does not publish them: `decoder_current_marker` and `decoder_version`.
`decoder_have_source` always reads _yes_, since a player is always meant to be
playing something.

### Presets

Two banks — **Multisite: main site** (Go live, End, status) and
**Multisite: campus** (Play, Hold, Resume, Catch up, Return to the room, Jog
either way, status) — with the feedbacks already attached. Only the campus bank
is offered against a campus player, with Hold or resume and Lock added.

Against an Outpost box the banks are **Outpost: encoder** or **Outpost: campus**,
whichever shape it is. The encoder bank adds Check the input, whether the web
stream is landing, and whether sound is arriving; both status buttons turn red
when the box stops answering.

Under each bank there is also a **Markers** group (main site) or a **Cues** group
(campus) with one button per cue, already named: _Sermon Start_, _Offering_, and
so on. Those are generated from the markers in play, so they change as the main
site's configuration and the room's markers do. The campus bank also carries a
**Drop a cue** group: one button whose name you set, to drop a cue from this
campus under the site name configured on that box.
